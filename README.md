Included are the first two builds for my first video game design for Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. 
These games were dwveloped with MIT's free Scratch language.
Included are the raw files for games.
To view source code for the games and to play, download the version you want, then go to the Scratch website and upload the file to your account.
Scratch can be found at www.scratch.MIT.edu
